# Solana infra

Solana is a paradise for traders, with abundant liquidity and extremely fast transaction speeds. However, due to Solana's different architecture from EVM and the use of the Rust contract development language, many users face a high learning curve.

Therefore, we have launched a complete trading infrastructure for Solana. With our trading infrastructure, you can quickly get started with on-chain trading on Solana. For most professional traders, speed is everything; if you are 400ms late, it could lead to significant losses.

By using our trading infrastructure to access market data and place orders, you can greatly reduce latency and make better trading decisions.

## Our Features

Professional Team: Team members are all professional high-frequency traders and MEV searchers.
Friendly API: Clear and user-friendly API interfaces.
Ultra-Low Latency: Gateway latency <1ms, on-chain P95 slot +1.
